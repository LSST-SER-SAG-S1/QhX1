Introduction
============

Variability in astronomical sources can manifest in multiple forms, intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic variability may be caused by changes in the physical conditions, such as those observed in Cepheid Variables or stellar flares, or it may be accretion-induced, as seen in cataclysmic variables and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Extrinsic variability, on the other hand, results from geometrical factors.

AGN, in particular, are known to exhibit variability of about 10% across various timescales, ranging from less than an hour to several years. This variability is not uniform across all AGN, presenting a wide spectrum of stochastic behavior. In response to the complex nature of the processes governing these variations, and the nonlinearity observed in quasar light curves, our package—Quasar harmonic eXplorer (QhX)—has been developed to include  a method for detecting periodic variability through the cross-correlation of wavelet transforms of quasar light curves in pairs of bands.

The purpose of this documentation is to guide users through the features and functionalities of QhX, facilitating the exploration and analysis of quasar light curves with an emphasis on periodic variability detection and analysis.
